# JavaScript
## 0x12 - Warm up

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:  
* Scripting (same as we did with Python)
* Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting.After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
